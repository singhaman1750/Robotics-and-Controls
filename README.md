# Robotics-and-Controls
This is a repo for the resources for the YouTube course on "Robotics and Control"! 
The lecture series is ideal for 2nd-and-3rd-year engineering undergraduates interested in robotics, though all are welcome. 
Lectures will be uploaded every Tuesday and Thursday at 5 PM.

## Course Syllabus
Python Basics, Coordinate Frames and Homogeneous Transformations, FK and IK (2D manipulators, Differential Drive), Jacobian and its applications, Dynamics and Euler-Lagrangian Equations, Optimization, Trajectory Optimization, and Trajectory Generation, Feedback Linearization, Linear Control, Understanding 3D Motions, D-H Algorithm for Manipulators
